## 🔖 What I Learned Today

- Today I learned about open source contribution how pull requests work, what is the roadmap in order to contribute to the community, how talking with the maintainers is important before even start to code talking is the first and foremost step.
- Then I started the other project which is dictionary web app which also gives meaning, synonyms, pronunciation with a user-friendly theme.

Today I worked on dictionary web app nav bar today I mainly worked on the theme change section and with an icon. I made a scroll button with help of div and completely designed the HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Examples:

      <nav>
        <div class="flex align-items gap-15">
          <div
            class="scroll-btn flex align-center p-3 box-border clickable relative"
          >
            <div class="scroll-ball absolute"></div>
          </div>
          <img src="/assets/icon-moon.svg" alt="moon" />
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```
